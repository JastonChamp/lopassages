Basically, it stops us floating about all over the place, which is something like what happens inside a satellite in space. Being such a long distance from home means that people who live in space cannot go home at the end of each day to sleep.

It was not far, just past Mark’s aunty’s farmyard.\n\nThey arrived at half past ten and Darcy parked the car under an arch by a barn. There had just been a harvest, and the calves were eating the fresh grass. They strolled past the calves to the path that led to the large market.\n\nAt the market, they saw many people hard at work selling their products. In one part, they saw an artist painting love hearts on a card, and in another part they saw a young girl standing on a stool on a tarnished carpet playing a large harp.\n\n“How much do you charge?” asked Darcy. “Five dollars for one song,” replied the girl. “That’s too expensive by far,” said Mark in reply.\n\nThey went to buy some lemonade from another young girl squeezing lemons. They also saw a man selling rhubarb and almond tarts from a cart. Then, in the last part of the market, there was a woman with a pile of dark garments. On them were little sparkling stars. They couldn’t believe how many garments were for sale.\n\nWhen Mark grew sleepy, he sat on the grass and started to play his guitar. People thought he was part of the market and gave him money for his songs. He and Darcy finally hopped back into the car and drove back to their apartment. Mark had managed to make twenty‑five dollars.\n\nDarcy smiled and remarked, “That was smart. We should go to the market each week!”",

He had on dark sunglasses. She smiled, but he looked at her hard. Her heart beat fast. She did not feel calm. “I feel alarmed,” she remarked to no one in particular. She reached a car yard selling cars and car parts. The sign read, “No trespassing.” An alarm was ringing and a guard dog barked as a guard put on its collar.\n\n“Have you seen a man with a scar and sunglasses?” asked the guard. “He just tried to steal a car.” Martha was startled. “Yes, he passed me in the park. He had dark sunglasses. He did alarm me. He can’t be far.” The guard with the barking dog ran after his target.\n\nMartha wanted to go home. She didn’t want to be apart from Harley and wished that she had not argued with him. She was startled when a car stopped next to her. Martha’s heart beat fast. She did not want extra drama. Then she realised that it was Harley in the car. She felt calm and got in. “I am very pleased you are here. Let me tell you a remarkable story,” she said.\n\nThat night they listened to the news on the radio about the alarm at the car yard. They were pleased to know that the guard had nabbed the man with the scar and that the police had put him behind bars.",

She could not find a pair of rare gold rings anywhere!\n\nThen, suddenly, Claire saw a chair that needed repairs. There they were, sitting on the damaged chair. Her arms shot up in the air with delight. Her parents would be so happy with her gift to them. Claire asked the lady selling her wares,\n\n\"How much for that pair of gold rings?\" The lady stared at Claire. \"They are quite rare. So they are twenty dollars for the pair,\" declared the lady. She glared at the rare gold rings and Claire was aware that she was not very happy. Then the lady said, \"They are so heavy they broke my chair.\"\n\nClaire was aware the rings would be heavy, so she had come prepared. She knew that she could cast a magic spell by rubbing them with her fairy hair. This would make them as light as air so they could float on their own. Claire flew home pulling the pair of rare gold rings behind her. When she got there, she went upstairs. She placed the rings on her own chair and … crack! The magic spell she had cast was over. The pair of gold rings were now heavy again and had broken her chair.\n\nClaire did not despair. She repaired the damaged chair and put the pair of gold rings back in their place on the chair. Claire, the fairly large fairy with the magnificent pair of green wings, looked happily at her chair with the pair of gold rings and thought, \"My parents will be so happy.

She would regularly swim to the surface and whisper to the Earth Brothers to help her meet a surface man so she could learn all about their world. Little did she know that her search was to end on this particular day.\n\nIt was the middle of a hot day in the underwater world and Esther swam happily searching for pearls as a surprise for her mother's birthday. As she rested on a large rock island, Esther saw a strange-looking object approaching her on top of the water. She felt uncertain because she had never seen an object like it before. As the object grew closer, Esther realised that it was a boat and that there was someone standing on top of the boat. The Earth Brothers had heard her wish to meet a surface man.\n\nThe man told Esther that he was a prince from a faraway world and that he was searching to find other worlds. He wanted to learn all about Esther's world too. He wanted Esther to return with him to work in his world. Esther was excited but knew that she could not live in a world that was not under the water.\n\nWhen Esther told the man this, he became angry and tried to catch Esther to take her with him. Esther turned and dived back under the water to escape and to tell her father and the people of her world about the prince.\n\nTo this day, mermaids and the people of their world keep watch for people from the world above the water.

      "text": "Once upon a time, in the days when elephants had only bumps for noses, there lived a young and inquisitive elephant girl. She lived with her family in the forest on the edge of the river. Like most inquisitive elephants, she asked many, many questions.\n\n\"Mother, Father, Brother, Sister,\" she would say, and she would ask any number of questions. Questions about why elephants laugh and why elephants cough. Questions about phantoms and pheasants.\n\nThis day her question was about the crocodile's smile. \"Mother, Father, Brother, Sister,\" she began to ask, \"why does the crocodile have such a big smile?\" Like many of the questions they were asked, the little elephant girl's family did not have the answer. This time the little elephant girl decided to ask Crocodile herself. She did not know that Crocodile liked to eat little elephant girls.\n\nThe little elephant girl marched off to the river bank where Crocodile lay basking in the sun. \"Excuse me, Crocodile,\" the little elephant girl politely asked. \"Can you tell me why you have such a big smile?\"\n\n\"Why certainly you may ask,\" replied Crocodile. \"I have diamonds to use instead of teeth,\" the sly croc lied.\n\n\"Oh! May I have a closer look at your diamond teeth?\" asked the little elephant girl, not sensing any danger.\n\n\"Why certainly; come a little closer and look at my teeth,\" said the crafty old lady croc, gliding into the water and swimming closer.\n\nThe little elephant girl moved closer too, closer and closer, until her bump of a nose was right next to the croc's teeth. SNAP! The crafty old croc bit her bump of a nose. The little elephant girl jumped back. The crafty old croc kept her hold on the little elephant girl's bump of a nose and pulled and pulled.\n\nThe little elephant girl was so surprised that she pulled and pulled too, trying to make the crafty old croc let go of her nose. As they both pulled and pulled, the little elephant girl's bump of a nose began to stretch and stretch until it was almost touching the earth.\n\nFinally the crafty old croc let go of the little elephant girl's nose and laughed at the long trunk that was now in the place where her little bump of a nose had once been. And that is why elephants no longer have a little bump for a nose and how the elephant got its trunk.",

He picked up the oars and rowed the boat as the sun started to warm the morning.\n\nHe watched in awe as a stork soared into the air. The crisp spring morning was adorable with no pollution in the air or in the water. Rory McCaw watched a storm brewing in the distance, making incredibly colourful shapes in the sky. Across on the other bank, a fawn put its hoof in the water. It was snorting and looking at its reflection below.\n\nLooking into the water under the boat, Rory McCaw saw four small prawns swimming. He thought that it would have been good to have brought a net. He could have caught some prawns. But he had not brought a net so the prawns swam away under his boat. As he leaned over to watch the prawns, he accidentally let go of the oars. Then, as he put his hand into the water to grab them, his shirt caught on a small nail. He leaned back and his shirt tore. Rory McCaw watched as the oars floated away.\n\nRory McCaw looked to shore. He couldn't row so he would have to swim ashore. As he jumped over the edge of the boat, his shorts caught on the same small nail and also tore.\n\nRory McCaw finally reached the shore. He was wet. He had no oars, no boat, no prawns. His shirt and his shorts were torn. Rory McCaw looked back at the river and realised that he still marvelled at the glorious morning.",

He was an absolute treasure and we knew that the television reporters would visit soon to take photos of his arrival. We had managed to keep him alive with a special machine that had caught the reporters' attention.\n\nWhen the vet arrived, he tore up some clean old rags to wipe the newly born fawn we called Sunny. He made sure his patient was healthy and strong. The vet talked with Dad for a while and then told him that Sunny was in fine form. He was happy for the reporters to view our precious little treasure.\n\nDad warned us to keep Sunny warm and keep the door of the barn closed. When the reporters arrived they set up a portable machine to send the vision of our newly born fawn to the rest of the world.\n\nThe reporters interviewed Dad about his invention that had kept the young fawn alive. We all watched the television that night to see the report on Sunny. It was very exciting to see all of our family on television and Dad's interview with the reporters. Sunny became an instant celebrity with everyone in the city.\n\nWhen we woke the next morning, Sunny was already standing and had helped himself to some of the food we had left out. It wasn't long before Sunny grew into a stag and we had to let him go back into the wild.\n\nAgain the reporters came to televise the release of our precious Sunny. He had become such a celebrity that the viewers wanted to know all about his progress.\n\nThe day we released Sunny into the wild, Mum and I watched as he raced towards the open field. We were sad to see him go but happy that he was alive and strong. Suddenly, Sunny turned and motioned towards us. It was like he was saying \"Thanks!\" I motioned back to Sunny and within an instant he was gone, back into the wild where he belonged.",

Owl was sitting on the bough where he always sat, watching the paddock looking for breakfast.\n\n\"Why are you making such a fuss?\" asked the large brown cow.\n\n\"It is Mother Mouse,\" replied the owl from the bough of the tree. \"She is hiding under some logs on the ground. I want her to think she is surrounded so I can catch her for my breakfast.\"\n\nThe large brown cow could see poor Mother Mouse hiding under some logs on the ground. She was not worried about the mouse but found the hooting owl's loud sound disturbed her own breakfast. She frowned. \"Owl!\" she called. \"This mouse is my friend. I want you to leave her alone and find some other mouse to eat for breakfast.\"\n\nThe owl knew that the mouse was not the large brown cow's friend, but knew also that the cow would be in the way if he tried to swoop down to the ground where the mouse hid. \"Very well,\" said the owl, \"I'll leave your friend alone.\"\n\nMother Mouse scampered out from under the logs on the ground to the safety of the fence. She thanked the large brown cow. \"You are very kind, Cow. I will one day return your favour.\" The large brown cow looked down at the tiny mouse and laughed. \"I think you are far too small to ever be able to help me,\" she replied and went back to her mound of delicious grass.\n\nIt was many months later when Mother Mouse heard loud sounds coming from the cow's paddock. A hound had chased the large brown cow and she had found herself trapped with some sharp vines wrapped around her hoof. The more the large brown cow pulled to escape the vines, the tighter they wrapped around her hoof. Mother Mouse recognised the large brown cow immediately and raced across the paddock to where the cow was trapped.\n\nShe knew that running in the open was dangerous because Owl, as always, was sitting on his bough watching the paddock.\n\nWhen she finally reached her, the large brown cow said, \"Mother Mouse, you are very brave to run across the open paddock when Owl is sitting on his bough watching. I think though, that your bravery is wasted when even I cannot break these vines.\" Mother Mouse wasted no time and began using her sharp teeth to chew away at the vines. Before long, the large brown cow was free.\n\nMother Mouse looked at the large brown cow and said, \"I am pleased to be able to return the favour.\" From that day on, Mother Mouse never had to worry about Owl sitting on his bough overlooking the paddock as her friend Cow was always there to protect her.",

I have been lying here, counting the clouds for hours but simply cannot go to sleep. What am I to do?\"\n\nThe sow was puzzled. She had never had trouble falling asleep. Her sty was always the perfect house for sleeping. She found the cow's predicament rather confounding. \"If I do not help the cow find a solution,\" thought the sow, \"I may well find myself with the same problem. This loud sound is bound to keep me awake all night!\"\n\nFinally, the sow suggested to the cow, \"How about I tell you a story? That is bound to help you fall asleep. It is what my mother used to do when I was a little piglet. I will tell you one of my mother's stories.\"\n\nThe cow was not listening.

Oh my!\" she said with a daisy in her mouth. \"I have been counting flowers for hours but simply cannot go to sleep. What am I to do?\"\n\nBut now the sow had a new problem. She could not think of a story to tell the cow. It had been a long time since her mother had told her any stories and now she could not remember one. She found her predicament rather confounding. \"If I do not tell the cow a story,\" thought the sow, \"she will not fall asleep and I may well find myself with the same problem.

Then, as she was about to give up hope of remembering a story, the sow recalled a special story about a spider called Charlotte and a pig called Wilbur who lived together in a barn.\n\nWhen the sow turned to tell the cow her story, she realised that the loud sound coming from the cow had stopped. The sow looked down to see that the cow was sleeping soundly.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the sow proudly. \"Now I will sleep soundly too.\" She trotted happily back around the barn to her sty and said, \"The end!\"\n\nAnd they both slept … happily ever after.",

Leroy found some oysters stuck to the rocks glistening in the water and Troy used a knife to open them. They all sat in the hot midday sun and ate the delicious oysters. \"This is why it's called Oyster Point,\" said Leroy. The day was perfect.\n\nTroy and his friends made their way back to where they had set up their campsite and collected wood to start a fire. They used the fire to boil water for tea. To cook their potatoes they wrapped them in foil and threw them into the hot coals. Then, when they had eaten their fill, Jeff watched Leroy and Troy toast marshmallows over the fire on the end of a stick. It was a perfect camping expedition.\n\nLater that night, Troy woke in his tent to voices he heard outside. He was surprised to find that the others were awake and that Jeff was very sick. \"I think the oysters were poisonous,\" said Jeff. \"I feel very sick.\" The boys were concerned because Oyster Point was a long way from other people. \"What will we do?\" asked Leroy. \"Jeff is very hot with a fever. I think he needs to see a doctor.\"\n\nThe boys knew that they would have to wait until the morning. They were deciding their next move when Jeff heard a noise in the bush and then they all heard a voice say, \"Has someone eaten poisonous oysters?\" It was the ranger. Troy's dad had asked the ranger to keep an eye on the boys.\n\n\"We are worried that Jeff has eaten poisonous oysters,\" the boys said to the ranger.\n\n\"Did you all eat oysters from the rocks?\" the ranger asked.\n\nThe boys nodded. \"Yes!\"\n\n\"I think that Jeff may be suffering from a slight case of heat stroke,\" said the ranger. \"It was very hot today and I think you would all be sick if the oysters were poisonous. Did you use sunscreen all day, Jeff?\"\n\nJeff looked surprised. He had not used sunscreen as he knew he should have.\n\n\"I'm sure you'll be fine in the morning,\" said the ranger, \"but you need to drink lots of water in the meantime.\"\n\nThe following day, Jeff was feeling much better.
